`install.packages(c('ordinal', 'ggplot2', 'ggeffects'))`

Finally, download the [R notebook in this repository](clm_intro.Rmd)!

Follow along as we:
- Discuss cutting-edge methods for ordinal data
- Learn why traditional methods might not be the best fit and how CLMs can enhance your analysis.
- Explore the equations behind CLMs and compare popular R packages.
- Explore and compare methods for visualizing CLMs
- Analyze clustered data using mixed-effects models (CLMMs)
